# Attendance System using Face Recognition

This project deals with attendance of using face recognition in python. I have used OpenCV for the completion of this project. Here, first your 20 pictures are taken and then a trainer trains the system and finally you can be recognised by the system.

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.6.4 (recommended)
Libraries:
1. OpenCV
2. OS
3. Time
4. Numpy
5. Pickle
6. Pillow


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Download the python 3.6.4 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/
2. Open the command prompt and download all the prerequisite libraries
3. Most of the libraries are easy to download.
4. Take this as an example for downloading https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXQp7GkRIHY if facing any problem


## Running the tests

1. Run the save_images.py if using the program for the first time.
2. Run face_train.py later that.
3. At last run face_recognition.py for the attendance.
