# Attendance System using Face Recognition

This project deals with attendance of using face recognition in python. I have used OpenCV for the completion of this project. Here, first your 20 pictures are taken and then a trainer trains the system and finally you can be recognised by the system.

## Getting Started

1. Run the save_images.py if using the program for the first time.
2. Run face_train later that.
3. At last run face_recognition for the attendance.

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.6.4 (recommended)
Libraries:
1. OpenCV
2. OS
3. Time
4. Numpy
5. Pickle
6. Pillow

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Download the python 3.6.4 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-364/
2. Remember to download 

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
